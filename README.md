# Installing

1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d`, if you already have it.
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/suvratapte/dot-emacs-dot-d.git ~/.emacs.d`
4. Open Emacs, it will download all the packages.
5. Start using! :tada:

### Note

This configuration is based on a [config](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure/archive/book1.zip) by [Daniel Higginbotham](https://twitter.com/nonrecursive) for his book [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/). That is when I started using Emacs on day-to-day basis. I read the whole config and made some changes. Removed the packages that I do not need (such as JS related packages). And now I'm building on top of that.
